// Minimal service worker placed in public/ so it is served at /service-worker.js
// This is intentionally lightweight: it ensures a service worker exists so
// PWABuilder and browsers detect PWA capability. For production you may
// want a more featureful worker generated by Workbox or CRA PWA template.

self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  // Activate worker immediately
  self.skipWaiting();
});

self.addEventListener('activate', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(self.clients.claim());
});

// NOTE: Removed a global fetch handler because returning non-HTML
// or simple text for navigation requests can cause the app to show a
// blank page. If you want offline caching, use a Workbox-generated
// service worker that precaches build assets and provides a proper
// navigation fallback. For now, keep the worker install/activate only.
